  All praise belongs to Allah, the One who taught by the pen, taught mankind that which he did not know, and made knowledge a light by which hearts are guided and actions are rectified. He sent His Messenger ﷺ with clear proofs, guidance, and the religion of truth, and He made the path to Him a path founded upon knowledge, certainty, and submission. From the greatest obligations upon the Muslim is seeking knowledge that leads him to worship Allah upon clarity, protects him from ignorance and misguidance, and enables him to fulfill the purpose for which he was created. 

# The Obligation of Knowledge 
Knowledge (_ʿIlm_) in the Arabic language can be summarized as being the opposite of ignorance (_jahl_), and it is to firmly understand and grasp a matter upon it's truth. 

In the Sharīʿah, knowledge refers to knowing what Allah has revealed in His Book and upon the tongue of His Messenger ﷺ, with understanding and submission, such that it leads to correct belief, sound worship, and upright conduct. Shaykh Ṣāliḥ al-Fawzān (حفظه الله) said:
> “What is meant by (knowledge) is: knowledge which Allah has revealed to His Messenger from the evidences and the guidance.” \\
> (Kitab al-'Ilm, p. 28)

Every Muslim is obligated to know how to worship his Lord upon clarity, and this cannot be attained except through knowledge. Allah did not create His servants to act blindly, nor did He accept deeds performed upon ignorance. Rather, He sent revelation as light and guidance, and He commanded His servants to learn it, understand it, and act upon it. For this reason, seeking knowledge is binding upon the believer according to what rectifies his faith and worship. It was narrated from Anas ibn Mālik رضي الله عنه that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:
> “Seeking knowledge is obligatory upon every Muslim.” \\
> (Sunan Ibn Mājah 224)

It's noteworthy to mention that the scholars of ḥadīth have examined this narration, and differed regarding it's authenticity. All of its narrators are trustworthy except for Ḥafṣ ibn Sulaymān, concerning whom there is disagreement. Imām al-Suyūṭī[^1], al-Zarqānī[^2], and al-Albānī[^3] authenticated it, while many others regarded it as weak. However, despite this difference, the scholars are united that the meaning of the narration is correct and firmly supported by corroborating evidences found in Qur’an and Sunnah. Imām Ibn al-Qayyim رحمه الله said:
> “Although it contains Ḥafṣ ibn Sulaymān in its chain, who is weak, its meaning is correct.” \\
> (Miftāḥ Dār al-Saʿādah, 1/480)

Likewise, Imām al-Nawawī رحمه الله said:
> “Weak, although its meaning is correct.”  \\
> (al-Majmūʿ, 287)

Another proof is found in the statement of the Messenger ﷺ. Abū Hurayrah رضي الله عنه reported that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:
> “Verily, Allah does not look at your appearance or your wealth, but rather He looks at your hearts and your actions.” \\
> (Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim 2564)

Allah does not accept worship except that it is founded upon knowledge. The meaning of this was clarified by Imām al-Fuḍayl ibn ʿIyāḍ رحمه الله, who said:
> “Allah, the Mighty and Majestic, accepts only those deeds which are both correct and sincere. If the deed is done correctly but not sincerely, it will not be accepted. And if it is sincere but not correct, it will not be accepted.”  
> He was asked, “What is the sincere and correct deed?” 
> He replied, “The sincere deed is one that is done only for Allah, and the correct deed is one done according to the Sunnah.” \\
> (Ḥilyat al-Awliyāʾ, 8/95)

Knowledge is therefore what allows the Muslim to distinguish between what Allah accepts and what He rejects, between obedience and innovation, and between guidance and misguidance. It is the means by which actions are corrected and placed upon the Straight Path, so that they conform to what Allah revealed and to the way shown by His Messenger ﷺ. For this reason, the obligation of worship cannot be separated from the obligation of learning how to worship. Imām al-Ājurrī رحمه الله said:
> “The seeker of knowledge should know that Allah, the Mighty and Majestic, has made worship obligatory upon him; and this worship is not possible except with knowledge, so the seeking of knowledge has also been made obligatory upon him. He should realize that ignorance is not befitting for a believer.” \\
> (Akhlāq al-ʿUlamāʾ, p. 43)

Thus, worship is only accepted when it is performed upon knowledge, in accordance with the Sunnah of the Messenger ﷺ. Knowledge is what illuminates the path of obedience, distinguishes truth from error, and places actions upon firm ground. Without it, deeds are exposed to rejection, and the servant walks in darkness while assuming that he is upon guidance.

With regards to which knowledge is obligatory, the obligation is defined by what a person needs to establish his religion correctly. ʿAbdullāh ibn al-Mubārak رحمه الله said:
> ”A man must not proceed to do anything except upon knowledge. He is to ask and learn. This is what is obligatory upon people as regards to learning knowledge. If there is a man who has no wealth, it is not obligatory upon him to learn (the rulings of) zakah. When he has two-hundred dirham, it becomes obligatory upon him to learn how much zakah he has to pay, when he has to pay, and who he has to pay.” \\
> (al-Baghdādī, al-Maqālah, p. 163)

It is incumbent on every Muslim to seek knowledge of that which is binding upon him in belief, worship, and daily conduct, such that he cannot be excused for ignorance of it. Without this knowledge, the religion cannot be correctly established. As for what exceeds these limits, then acquiring knowledge of it is a collective obligation (farḍ kifāyah) upon the Ummah. If some fulfill it, the sin is lifted from the rest, though pursuing it remains virtuous and recommended.

# That Which Opposes Knowledge
Today, the departure of knowledge from the Muslim ummah is plainly witnessed, not by the disappearance of books or the absence of speech, but by the loss of true understanding. In its place, ignorance has become widespread, and confusion has settled into the hearts of many. From the most dangerous manifestations of this ignorance is the emergence of the _ruwaybiḍah_; those who possess little to no understanding of the Book of Allah and the Sunnah, yet present themselves as scholars and imams, issuing judgments, and speaking about the religion without knowledge. 

This reality was foretold by the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, who said:
> “Verily, Allah does not take away knowledge by snatching it from the people, but He takes away knowledge by taking away the scholars. When He leaves no learned person, people take the ignorant as their leaders. They are asked, and they give verdicts without knowledge. They go astray and lead others astray.”  \\
> (Muslim 2673)

For this reason, it is of increasing importance for the Muslim to preoccupy himself with seeking knowledge, for within it is great virtue and success, and what opposes it is ignorance and failure. Through it, the servant learns what Allah has commanded and what He has forbidden, what leads to His pleasure and what leads to His anger. Knowledge is what dispels falsehood, and prevents a person from being misled by those who speak without it. 

This was expressed by the noble Shaykh Sulaymān al-Ruḥaylī حفظه الله, who said:
> “It is known that knowledge is the root of every good, just as ignorance is the root of every evil. There is no good except that knowledge guides to it, and there is no evil except that ignorance is deeply entangled in it.” \\
> (al-Ifādah wa’l-Tabyān, p. 5)

Every path that leads to goodness begins with learning, understanding, and adherence to revelation. Every descent into corruption is accompanied by ignorance, whether it appears in belief, worship, or conduct. Whoever seeks safety for his religion must begin by learning it, and whoever turns away from knowledge exposes himself to being led by those who have none

# Conclusion
Seeking knowledge is an obligation, a virtue, and a means of salvation. Through it, Allah is known, worship is corrected, and the Straight Path is illuminated. Opposing it is ignorance, misguidance, and destruction. Therefore, it is upon the Muslim to preoccupy himself with beneficial knowledge, to act upon it with sincerity, and to guard himself from speaking and acting without knowledge.

    summary: "This article explains the clear and preserved sources a Muslim always returns back to; the Qur'an and Sunnah, upon the understanding of the Salaf.",

  All praise belongs to Allah, who sent down His religion to the Messenger ﷺ and preserved it so that people may find guidance. The religion of Islam is built upon clear and preserved revelation. When disagreements arise or confusion appears, the Muslim does not rely on personal whims and desires, rather he returns to what Allah revealed: the Qur’an and the Sunnah of His Messenger ﷺ, understood as they were by the best of generations, the Salaf al-Ṣāliḥ (Pious Predecessors). This is the Straight Path, and incumbent upon the Muslim is to adhere, submit, and cling to it, and protect it from what opposes it, lest he fall into misguidance and deviance. 

  # The Qur'an
  The Qur’an is the central text of Islam and the final revelation that Allah sent down to the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ over the span of twenty-three years. It was revealed as a mercy to humanity, to guide and nurture them upon divine principles of belief, worship, law, and character.

  To ensure this guidance would remain unchanged for all generations, Allah safeguarded the Qur’an by His own authority, guaranteeing its integrity across time. He says:
  > It is certainly We (Allah) who has sent this reminder (The Qur'an), and it is we who will preserve it. \\
  > (Surah al-Hijr 15:9)

  This divine assurance was realized through a meticulous system during the lives of the Messenger ﷺ and his Companions. The Qur'an emerged in a society that placed exceptional emphasis on memorization, and thereby oral transmission was a primary means of preservation. From the beginning of it's revelation, the Qur'an was recited and memorized by companions of the Prophet Muhammad such as Abū Bakr al-Ṣiddīq, ʿUmar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb, ʿUthmān ibn ʿAffān, ʿAlī ibn Abī Ṭālib, Ubayy ibn Kaʿb, ʿAbdullāh ibn Masʿūd, Muʿādh ibn Jabal, Zayd ibn Thābit and Abū al-Dardāʾ (رضي الله عنهم).[^1]Verses were also recorded by scribes, forming a system of oral and written cross-verification.[^2] After the Prophet's death, Abū Bakr tasked Zayd ibn Thābit, who had memorized the Qur'an, with gathering the text, which was later standardized into an official codex during the caliphate of ʿUthmān.[^3] Early manuscripts such as the Birmingham and Ṣanʿāʾ Qur’ans, dated to the Prophet’s lifetime, match today’s text,[^4] as does the Topkapi manuscript from the time of ʿUthmān, which preserves ninety-nine percent of the Qur’an.[^5]

  The Qur’an legislates the obligation to follow, adhere to, and judge by its guidance, as Allah states:
  > Follow what has been revealed to you from your Lord (i.e. The Qur'an), and do not take others as guardians besides Him. \\
  > (Surah al-Aʿrāf 7:3)

  And so, obligated is the Muslim to submit to the preserved speech of Allah, to accept the Qur’an in its entirety, and to adhere to its guidance. The Muslim learns, memorizes, and reflects upon its verses with sincerity and humility, without selectively embracing or abandoning any part of it due to one's whims and desires. Even when one struggles to fully uphold its commands, the obligation remains to believe in it completely, to strive to live by it, and to return to it in repentance and reliance upon Allah, for guidance is found in holding firmly to the Book that Allah has preserved and sent as a mercy to mankind.

  # The Sunnah
  In the Arabic language, the word _Sunnah_ (سُنَّة) refers to a path, way, or established practice that is followed. In the Sharīʿah, the Sunnah refers to everything that is authentically reported from the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ apart from the Qur’an. Al-Ḥāfiẓ ibn Ḥajar said:
  > The Sunnah is the path which is traversed, so that comprises holding firmly to that which the Prophet ﷺ and his rightly guided Caliphs were upon by way of beliefs and actions and statements. \\
  > (Jāmiʿ al-ʿUlūm wa al-Ḥikam, p. 262)

  The Qur’an makes clear that obedience to the Messenger ﷺ is an obligation and that his guidance is revelation, just as the Qur'an is revelation. Allah says:
  > And nor does he (Muhammad) speak of his own desire. It is only a Revelation revealed. \\
  > (Surah an-Najm 53:3-4)

  And He says:
  > And obey Allah and the Messenger that you may obtain mercy.  \\
  > (Surah al-Imran 3:132)

  He also says:
  > He who obeys the Messenger has obeyed Allah.  \\
  > (Surah an-Nisa 4:80)

  And He says:
  > And whatever the Messenger has given you – take; and what he has forbidden you – refrain from.  \\
  > (Surah al-Hashr 59:7)

  And He takes an oath, saying:
  > By your Lord, they will never be ˹true˺ believers until they accept you ˹O Prophet˺ as the judge in their disputes.  \\
  > (Surah an-Nisa 4:65)

  And He says:
  > Our Lord! Send amongst them a Messenger of their own, who shall recite unto them Your verses and instruct them in the Book (the Qur'ān) and Al-Ḥikmah (wisdom) and sanctify them. \\
  > (Surah al-Baqarah 2:129)

  Regarding this verse, it is reported that Al-Ḥasan Al-Baṣrī (رَحِمَهُ الله) said:
  >_The Book_  is the Qur'ān, and  _Al-Ḥikmah_  is the Sunnah. \\
  > (Sharḥ Usūl I’tiqād Ahl Al-Sunnah wa Al-Jamā’ah_ Vol.1, p. 86-87)

  and Qatādah (رَحِمَهُ الله) said:
  > And (he will) teach them _The Book_ and _Al-Ḥikmah_, i.e. the Sunnah. \\
  > (Al-Ibānah Al-Kubrā  Vol.1, p. 98)

  These verses together establish the obligation to follow the Sunnah, affirming that The Messenger ﷺ's guidance is not separate from revelation but is itself revealed by Allah. The Qur’an commands believers to take what the Messenger gives and to refrain from what he forbids, making obedience to him synonymous with obedience to Allah and requiring that his judgments be accepted without reservation. The Sunnah explains and clarifies the Qur’an by detailing its prescribed commandments, and demonstrating how they are applied. The Qur’an establishes the obligations of acts such as prayer, zakah, and without detailing them, while the Sunnah provides their explanation and practical detail, without which they cannot be correctly understood or carried out. This is also mentioned in the statement of Allah, The Most High:
  > And We have sent down to you ˹O Prophet˺ the Reminder, so that you may explain to people what has been revealed for them.  
  > (Surah an-Nahl 16:44)

  Similarly, it is reported that the Companion of the Messenger ﷺ, ʿImrān ibn Ḥuṣayn رَضِيَ اللهُ عَنْهُ, was once relating hadīth amongst a group of people, when a man said:
  > "Leave this and give us something from the Book of Allāh." 
  > ‘Imrān said, “You are a dunce (stupid). Do you find in the Book of Allāh details of prayer. Do you find in the Book of Allāh details of fasting? This Qur'ān prescribes those matters, and the Sunnah explains them.” \\
  > (Dhamm al-Kalām, al-Harawī, no. 244)

  Allah’s preservation of revelation is not left to human effort alone, but rests upon His own divine guarantee. Allah says:
  > It is certainly We who have sent down the Reminder, and it is We who will surely preserve it.  
  > (Surah al-Ḥijr 15:9)

  The scholars of Islam have explained that the _dhikr_ mentioned in this verse is not limited to the Qur’an alone, but includes everything by which the religion is preserved and clarified. Since the Sunnah is revelation and the authoritative explanation of the Qur’an, it necessarily falls under this divine protection. Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr رحمه الله explained this reality when discussing the role of the Sunnah in relation to the Qur’an:
  > The commentary of the Prophet ﷺ on the Qur’an is of two types:
  > 1. Explaining matters mentioned in general terms in the Qur’an, such as the five daily prayers, their times, bowing, prostration, and other rulings.
  > 2. Adding rulings to those of the Qur’an, such as the prohibition of being married to a woman and her paternal or maternal aunt at the same time. \\
  > (Jaami‘ Bayaan al-‘Ilm wa Fadlihi, 2/190)

  Because the Sunnah is the second part of revelation, inseparable from the Qur’an, Allah’s promise to preserve the _dhikr_ necessarily includes preserving the Sunnah as well. Without it, the Qur’an could not be correctly understood, practiced, or implemented.

  The preservation of the Sunnah began first with oral memorization, just as with the Qur’an. The Companions memorized the words, actions, and approvals of the Messenger ﷺ, before teaching it to others. 
  Anas ibn Mālik (رَضِيَ اللهُ عَنْهُ) described how the Companions would sit with the Prophet ﷺ, learn the ḥadīth, and cultivate it in their hearts:
  > We sat with the Prophet ﷺ, maybe sixty persons in number, and the Prophet ﷺ taught them ḥadīth. Later on, when he went out for any necessity, we used to memorize it amongst ourselves; when we departed, it was as if it was cultivated in our hearts.  
  > (al-Jāmiʿ li Akhlāq al-Rāwī wa Ādāb al-Sāmiʿ)

  Memorization was closely tied to practice. The Sunnah was applied in worship, daily routines, manners, and personal behavior. By living according to the Prophet’s ﷺ teachings, the Companions retained them naturally, passing them on through consistent action as well as careful recollection.

  This deep attachment to the Sunnah was driven by immense love for the Messenger ﷺ and his Sunnah. 
  As Anas ibn Mālik (رَضِيَ اللهُ عَنْهُ) said:
  > I saw Allah’s Messenger ﷺ going after the pumpkin around the dish, so I have always liked the pumpkin since that day.  
  > (Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim 2041)

  Alongside memorization and practice, the Prophet ﷺ also directed his Companions to record his words and actions. ʿAbdullāh ibn ʿAmr رَضِيَ اللهُ عَنْهُ reported that the Messenger ﷺ said:
  > Preserve the knowledge.” He said, “How should I preserve it?” He replied, “By writing it.” \\
  > (al-Mustadrak ʿalā al-Ṣaḥīḥayn, 1/106)

  And in His ﷺ statement:
  > Write (my ḥadīth). By the One in whose hand is my soul, nothing comes from this mouth except the truth. 
  > (Sunan Abī Dāwūd 3646)

  This emphasis on documentation allowed the Sunnah to be preserved alongside oral transmission. Abū Hurayrah رَضِيَ اللهُ عَنْهُ explained his extensive narration by saying:
  > The people say that Abū Hurayrah narrates too many narrations. In fact Allah knows whether I say the truth or not. They also ask, "Why do the emigrants and the Ansar not narrate as he does?" In fact, my emigrant brethren were busy trading in the markets, and my Ansar brethren were busy with their properties. I was a poor man keeping the company of Allah's Messenger ﷺ and was satisfied with what filled my stomach. So, I used to be present while they (i.e. the emigrants and the Ansar) were absent, and I used to remember while they forgot (the Hadith)
  > (Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī 2350)

  This careful preservation continued through teaching and transmission. The Companions emphasized the importance of memorizing and repeatedly reviewing the Hadith to their students. 
  ʿAlī ibn Abī Ṭālib (رَضِيَ اللهُ عَنْهُ) advised his students:
  > Repeat the aḥādīth frequently. If you do not, your knowledge will diminish. \\
  > (Jāmiʿ Bayān al-ʿIlm wa Faḍlihi, 101)

  ʿAbdullāh ibn Masʿūd رَضِيَ اللهُ عَنْهُ similarly said::
  > Repeat the ahadith regularly because this is the way to keep them alive. \\
  > (Maʿrifat ʿUlūm al-Ḥadīth, 141)

  The students of the Companions, the _Tābiʿūn_, undertook the systematic collection of Hadith to preserve the Prophet’s ﷺ teachings for the Ummah. Foundational works such as Imām Mālik’s _Muwaṭṭaʾ_, Imām Aḥmad ibn Ḥanbal’s _Musnad_, and later the compilations of Imām Muslim and others gathered vast numbers of narrations transmitted from the Companions and their students. Because these early collections intentionally included reports of varying strength, this effort was accompanied by the development of the precise sciences of Hadith. Scholars meticulously examined the isnad (chain of narrators), documenting the biographies, character, memory, integrity, and reliability of each narrator. Entire disciplines were dedicated to identifying trustworthy narrators, exposing fabricators, and classifying narrations as authentic (ṣaḥīḥ), sound (ḥasan), weak (ḍa‘īf), or fabricated. Through this process, the Sunnah was preserved in a clear and organized way, allowing Muslims to distinguish what is truly attributed to the Messenger ﷺ. 

  So, just as it is not permissible to believe in part of the Qur’an while abandoning any of it, even a single verse or letter, the same applies to the Sunnah. One’s belief is not complete unless the Sunnah is accepted in its entirety, without rejecting anything authentically reported from the Messenger ﷺ. For the Sunnah is a source of clarity and direction that leads to uprightness, while turning away from it results in confusion and loss. Imām Al-Barbahārī (رَضِيَ اللهُ عَنْهُ) stated: 
  > Likewise, Allāh will not accept from a person anything of the Sunnah whilst he abandons some of it, and whoever rejects anything from the Sunnah has rejected all of it, so upon you is to accept (it all). \\
  > (It’hāf Al-Qārī bi Ta’liqāt ‘alā Sharhis-Sunnah, Vol. 2/105-17)

  Thus, it is necessary to believe in the Sunnah in its entirety, accepting all that is authentically reported from the Messenger ﷺ without exception. It is upon the Muslim to ground his beliefs firmly in the Qur’an and the Sunnah, making them the measure by which all matters are understood. Through them truth becomes clear, and whatever accords with them is illuminated by light, while whatever departs from them is left in darkness.

  # The Salaf al-Ṣāliḥ 
  It is obligatory upon the Muslim to follow the Qur'an and Sunnah upon the understanding of the Salaf al-Ṣāliḥ (Pious Predecessors). Allah sent His Messenger ﷺ with the Qur'an, who remained upon the earth explaining and clarifying it through the Sunnah. His Ṣaḥābah (Companions) learned, memorised, implemented and conveyed his teachings to their students, the Tābi’īn; who did so to the next generation, the atbā’ Tābi’īn. These three generations are collectively known as the Salaf. The ensuing generations of Muslims cannot correctly understand and implement the Qur’ān and Ḥadīth without knowing how the Salaf understood them. This is the Straight Path that Allah laid down for His servants, and made clear through those who walked upon it first. It is upon the Muslim to hold fast to it, to submit to it inwardly and outwardly, and to protect it from anything that seeks to oppose it. 

  The word _Salaf_ linguistically refers to those who came before, while _Ṣāliḥ_ means righteous or upright. Together, _al-Salaf al-Ṣāliḥ_ refers to the early righteous generations of Islam. In the Sharīʿah, this term specifically denotes the Companions of the Messenger ﷺ, their students the Tābiʿūn, and the students of the Tābiʿūn. They are called the Salaf because they preceded the Ummah in time, and they are described as righteous because of their sound belief, correct understanding, and sincere adherence to the Qur’an and Sunnah, as mentioned in the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of his Messenger ﷺ. 

  Allah explicitly praised the Companions in the Qur’an and tied His pleasure to following their path. He said:
  > And the first to embrace Islam of the Muhājirūn and the Anṣār and those who followed them with excellence. Allah is pleased with them and they are pleased with Him. He has prepared for them gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they will abide forever. \\
  > (Surah At-Tawbah 9:100)

  And He says:
  > So those who emigrated, were driven from their homes, were harmed in My cause, fought, and were killed—I will surely remove their sins from them and admit them to gardens beneath which rivers flow, as a reward from Allah. And Allah has with Him the best reward. \\
  > (Surah Āl-Imrān 3:195)

  These verse refer to the Muhājirūn and the Anṣār, the Companions of the Messenger ﷺ, and the Helpers of Madinah who supported him. For this reason, they hold a rank in Islam that no later generation can reach, and their path remains the measure by which belief and practice are understood.

  Allah also says:
  > Certainly Allah was pleased with the believers when they pledged allegiance to you under the tree. He knew what was in their hearts, so He sent down tranquility upon them and rewarded them with a near victory.
  > (Surah Al-Fatḥ 48:18)

  This verse was revealed regarding the pledge of allegiance taken underneath a tree at al-Ḥudaybiyah by the early Companions of the Messenger ﷺ, numbered 1400.

  Together, these verses show that the Companions were praised explicitly by Allah, that their faith was tested and proven, and that following their path is inseparable from following the religion itself. Their loyalty to the Messenger ﷺ, their sacrifices for Islam, and their firm adherence under trial made them the best of this Ummah and the foundation upon which later generations must build.

  After the Companions came the _Tābiʿūn_, those who met the Companions, learned directly from them, and followed their path in faith and practice. After them came the _Atbāʿ al-Tābiʿīn_, the students of the Tābiʿūn, who inherited this knowledge and carried it forward. Together with the Companions, these three generations are known as the Salaf, distinguished not merely by their closeness in time to revelation, but by their firm adherence to the Qur’an and Sunnah, their sound understanding, and their sincerity in worship and conduct.

  The Messenger of Allah ﷺ explicitly praised these generations and placed them above all others. ʿAbdullāh ibn Masʿūd رضي الله عنه reported that the Prophet ﷺ said:
  > The best people are those of my generation, then those who come after them, then those who come after them.  
  > (Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī 6429)

  And he ﷺ also said:
  > I enjoin you to follow my companions, then those after them and those after them.  
  > (Sunan al-Tirmidhī 2165)

  These narrations establish that goodness, sound understanding, and upright practice are most complete in these early generations, and that later Muslims are commanded to follow their way in holding fast to the Qur’an and Sunnah.

  The Salaf as a whole are protected from agreeing upon misguidance, and are collectively free from error as a group. At the same time, they were human beings who sometimes differed and erred in individual judgments. They themselves clearly understood that none of their statements or opinions were independent sources of religion. Their authority lay in how faithfully and accurately they understood and applied the Sunnah of the Messenger ﷺ. Mujāhid ibn Jabr, a leading student of Ibn ʿAbbās (رَضِيَ اللهُ عَنْهُمَا), said:
  > There is no one whose opinion may not be taken or left, except for the Messenger of Allah ﷺ.  
  > (al-Madkhal ilā al-Sunan al-Kubrā, 30)

  This principle was also clearly stated by Abū Bakr al-Ṣiddīq رضي الله عنه, the greatest of the Companions after the Prophet ﷺ, who said:
  > If my opinion is correct, it is from Allah. If it is mistaken, it is from myself and Satan. Allah and His Messenger are innocent of it.  
  > (Sunan Abī Dāwūd 2116)

  Thus, the Muslim is one who returns to the way of the Salaf in belief, worship, and conduct, weighing their understanding of the religion against what they (The Salaf) understood and every practice against what they established. Through them, the religion remained upright, its meanings intact, and its limits known. Whoever walks their path walks upon clarity, and whoever departs from it exposes himself to confusion and error.

  # Conclusion
  Indeed, all praise belongs to Allah, who sent down His religion to His Messenger ﷺ in clarity, and preserved it from alteration through the generations who inherited and transmitted it. The path of Islam is clear; and that is, to follow the Book of Allah, the Sunnah of his Messenger ﷺ, upon the understanding of the Salaf al-Ṣāliḥ. This is the Straight Path, and it is binding upon every Muslim to submit to it, to cling to it firmly, and to guard it from what opposes it. The Muslim is one find attainment and salvation in this path alone, for success lies not in personal desires, nor in the statements of individuals, or of any particular faction or group, rather, it lies in returning to what Allah revealed and to the understanding of those whom He praised and chose to preserve His religion. And we ask Allah to place us among those who recognize this path, love it, remain firm upon it in times of ease and hardship, and are raised upon it on the Day of Judgment.

  Throughout history, humans have proposed various religions and creeds in an effort to understand existence, purpose, and morality. Yet their fundamental differences make it impossible for all of them to be equally correct. This raises a serious and unavoidable question: if truth is singular, which belief system reflects it? Islam claims to provide a coherent and universal framework for understanding God, morality, and human purpose. This article argues that this claim not only withstands scrutiny, but emerges as the most coherent explanation of truth.

  # The Necessity of a Creator
  Everything that begins to exist has a cause. This is a basic principle of reason that underlies all scientific and everyday explanations. The universe itself began to exist, a conclusion supported by modern cosmology, which points to a finite past and an initial beginning of space, time, and matter. If the universe began to exist, it cannot be the cause of its own existence. Its cause must therefore exist outside the universe. Because matter, energy, space, and time all began with the universe, this cause cannot be material, physical, or bound by time. Nor can it be limited or dependent, since all limits and dependencies arise only within the universe itself.

  Everything we observe within the universe exists in a state of dependence. Objects depend on prior conditions, causes, or components to exist and continue existing. If every dependent thing were explained only by another dependent thing, this would result in an infinite chain of dependencies with no ultimate foundation. Such a chain does not actually explain why anything exists at all, much like an infinite series of suspended links cannot hang without something holding the entire chain up. For existence to be intelligible, there must be a terminating point: a being that does not depend on anything else for its existence, but instead sustains everything else. Without such a foundational source, the existence of the universe remains unexplained.

  Beyond existence itself, the structure of the universe also points toward intention. The universe operates according to precise physical laws and constants that govern everything from gravity to electromagnetism. These values fall within extraordinarily narrow ranges that allow for complexity, stability, and life. Even slight deviations would result in a universe incapable of forming stars, chemistry, or living organisms. While chance can account for simple outcomes, it struggles to plausibly explain systems that are both highly ordered and finely balanced. The more reasonable explanation is that these conditions reflect deliberate calibration rather than coincidence, pointing toward an intelligent cause behind the universe.

  Human moral experience offers further insight. People intuitively recognize certain moral truths as objective, such as the idea that justice is better than injustice or that cruelty is wrong even when it benefits the powerful. These judgments are not treated as personal preferences in the way tastes are, but as claims that hold regardless of opinion. If morality were merely a product of biology, social agreement, or evolutionary advantage, no moral rule could be truly binding. Objective moral obligations make the most sense if they are grounded in something beyond human societies: a moral source that transcends individual and cultural perspectives.

  Together, these considerations converge to a single conclusion: the best explanation for the existence, structure, and moral dimension of reality is a Creator who is uncaused, independent, intelligent, powerful, and morally authoritative. Such a being is not one object within the universe, but the ultimate foundation upon which the universe depends.

  # The Oneness of God
  If God is the ultimate explanation for why anything exists at all, then He must be a necessary being. A necessary being is one whose existence does not depend on anything else and whose nonexistence is impossible. Everything else we observe is contingent, meaning it exists only because of prior causes and conditions. The foundation of reality cannot be contingent in this way, since something dependent cannot ultimately explain existence itself. The ultimate source must therefore exist by its own nature and sustain everything else without being sustained.

  The concept of multiple gods stands in direct conflict with this idea of necessary existence. If there were more than one god, then either one would be able to overpower or override the other, or neither would have such authority. If one could overcome the other, then only the one with ultimate authority would be truly necessary, while the other would be dependent and therefore not divine. If neither could overcome the other and both were equal, then neither would be necessary, because the existence of reality would not depend uniquely on either one. In that case, their existence would be redundant, and neither could serve as the ultimate explanation for all that exists. Necessary existence, by definition, cannot be shared.

  For the same reason, God cannot be part of the created order or take on the attributes of creation. Everything within the universe is subject to change, dependence, and external influence. To become part of creation, or to incarnate within it, would require God to acquire limitations that He did not previously have, such as occupying space, undergoing change, or being affected by external forces. This would imply that God can move from perfection to imperfection, or from independence to dependence, which is a logical contradiction. A perfect and necessary being cannot lose essential attributes without ceasing to be what it is.

  Islam’s concept of God follows directly from this line of reasoning. God is understood as the one necessary existence upon which all else depends. He is eternal, self-sufficient, all-powerful, and all-knowing, while remaining completely independent of creation. Nothing sustains Him, and nothing resembles Him. This conception preserves the coherence of God as the ultimate explanation of existence and avoids the contradictions that arise when necessity, dependency, and plurality are confused.

  # The Necessity of Revelation

  Human reason is a powerful tool. It allows us to investigate the natural world, identify patterns, and draw conclusions about cause and effect. Yet its reach is limited. Reason can describe how things function, but it struggles to determine ultimate purpose, binding moral obligation, or final accountability with certainty. Questions such as the meaning of life, the source of moral duties, and the nature of life after death lie beyond what observation and logic alone can conclusively establish. This limitation is evident in the persistent disagreements among philosophers and cultures, each offering internally coherent yet mutually incompatible conclusions. The same difficulty arises with morality. While people share broad moral intuitions, reason alone has not yielded a single, objective standard for which moral duties are truly binding rather than socially constructed or personally chosen.

  The persistent disagreement across cultures and eras is not accidental. It reflects the fact that human reason, by itself, is not equipped to resolve questions that extend beyond the physical world and immediate experience. If human beings were created with a specific purpose and are accountable for how they live, then that purpose and standard of accountability cannot be reliably discovered through speculation alone. Guidance of this kind would need to come from a source that stands outside human limitation and has full knowledge of both the seen and unseen.

  Revelation, in this context, is not an arbitrary religious claim but a logical necessity. Without revealed guidance, human beings are left to navigate ultimate questions using tools that consistently produce disagreement and uncertainty. Revelation provides a fixed reference point that clarifies purpose, grounds moral obligation, and addresses the reality of life beyond death. It serves as the missing link between human reason and ultimate truth, allowing reason to operate with direction rather than guesswork.

  # The Qur’an as Divine Revelation

  The central text of Islam, the Qur’an, presents itself not as human reflection on the divine but as direct revelation from God. This claim is distinctive in that the Qur’an itself functions as Islam’s primary miracle and proof of prophethood, rather than relying mainly on external wonders or later theological interpretation. The text positions its own language, structure, and content as an ongoing, publicly accessible sign that invites examination.

  Any assessment of this claim must begin with the question of textual reliability. The Qur'an emerged in a society that placed exceptional emphasis on memorization, embedding recitation into daily worship, communal life, and education. Oral transmission was therefore not secondary to writing but a central means of preservation. From the beginning, the Qur'an was recited, memorized by companions of the Prophet Muhammad such as Abu Bakr al-Ṣiddīq, Umar ibn al-Khattāb, Uthmān ibn Affan, Ali ibn Abi Talib, Ubayy ibn Ka'b, Abdullah ibn Mas'ud, Mu'adh ibn Jabal, Zayd ibn Thabit and Abu al-Darda'.[^1] When verses of the Qur'an were revealed, they were written down by scribes, while memorizers created a dual system of oral and written cross-verification.[^2] After the Prophet's death, this system formed the basis of a careful compilation process. The first caliph, Abu Bakr, tasked Zayd ibn Thabit, who had memorized the Qur'an, with gathering the text, only accepting written passages with two witnesses confirming it. The third caliph, Uthmān, then produced an official codex from this collection.[^3] The Birmingham and Ṣanʿāʾ Qur'anic manuscripts have been radiocarbon dated back to the lifetime of the  Prophet Muhammad; its text matching today's Qur'an without any error.[^4] Similarly, the Topkapi manuscript, dated to the caliphate of ʿUthmān ibn ʿAffān, preserves ninety-nine percent of the Qur'anic text, and matches perfectly with today's Qur'an.[^5] 

  The question of whether such a text could be divine also turns on its literary character, and here again the Qur’an occupies a peculiar space in the eyes of specialists. Classical Arab critics and modern literary scholars describe it as a unique fusion of metrical and non‑metrical composition that follows neither the fixed meters of Arabic poetry nor the looser structures of rhymed prose, yet remains grammatically precise and rhetorically powerful. The text explicitly invites readers and listeners to produce something comparable, a challenge that was issued in a society renowned for its eloquence and literary sophistication. 

  > And if you are in doubt about what We have sent down upon Our
  > servant, then produce a chapter like it.
  > (Qur’an 2:23)

  Despite this, no comparable work has ever emerged, and the Qur’an continues to be recognized for its extraordinary eloquence, even by academics who do not accept its religious claims. As A. J. Arberry, who described himself as "no Muslim," observed:

  > In choosing to call the present work *The Koran Interpreted*, I have
  > conceded the relevancy of the orthodox Muslim view, that the Koran is
  > untranslatable. Briefly, the rhetoric and rhythm of the Arabic of the Koran are
  > so characteristic, so powerful, so highly emotive, that any version
  > whatsoever is bound in the nature of things to be but a poor copy of
  > the glittering splendour of the original.[^6]

  Internal coherence is another line of reasoning that becomes significant once one recognizes the historical circumstances of the Qur’an’s emergence. The text was revealed over roughly twenty‑three years, in varying social and political contexts, addressing matters as diverse as theology, law, personal ethics, prophetic history, and public policy, yet it consistently articulates a unified view of God, human responsibility, and the moral order. Modern commentators have taken this as an argument from internal consistency: across its many parables, exhortations, and legal pronouncements, the Qur’an presents recurring themes: divine oneness, accountability, justice, and mercy. 

  Finally, the Qur’an appeals to “signs" in a restrained, cumulative way rather than through sensationalism. The Qur’an frequently directs readers to ponder historical outcomes, human psychology, and patterns in nature, not as scientific treatise, but as converging indications of a purposeful, moral reality and a God who communicates with humanity. Historians of late antiquity note that one of the Qur’an’s striking predictions concerns the fortunes of the Byzantine (Roman) Empire: in a period when the Byzantines had suffered devastating defeats at Persian hands, the Qur’an declared they would soon prevail again, a reversal that did in fact occur within the time frame specified. 

  > The Romans have been defeated in a nearby land, but after their defeat they will overcome within a few years. \\
  > (Qur’an 30:2–4)

  This has been analyzed as a case where the text stakes its credibility on a public, falsifiable forecast rather than on vague, unfalsifiable claims. At a broader level, scholars of religion point to the survival and expansion of Islam from a small, persecuted community in western Arabia to a world‑shaping civilization as an instance of the Qur’an’s own claim that its message would be preserved and its community established despite opposition, a claim encapsulated in verses promising divine protection of the scripture and ultimate vindication of the Prophet’s mission. Together, preservation, linguistic uniqueness, internal consistency, and predictive signs form a compelling case that the Qur’an is not merely a human product but a revelation that fulfills the necessary role of guiding humanity where reason alone cannot reach.

  # The Prophethood of Muhammad ﷺ

  The remarkable preservation of the Qur’an naturally raises the question the prophethood of Muhammad ﷺ, the man who conveyed it to the world. Long before he proclaimed his mission at the age of forty, Muhammad ﷺwas renowned among his people for his character, earning the title al-Amīn (the trustworthy) from those who later opposed him. Pre-Islamic sources and early biographies confirm that merchants like Khadijah bint Khuwaylid entrusted him with their caravans precisely because of this reputation, He actively shunned the tribal power struggles and idol worship prevalent in Mecca, preferring solitude in the caves of Mount Hira to reflect on the moral decay around him, and his message of monotheism brought immediate boycott, exile, and the loss of wealth, kin, and status rather than any personal gain.[^7]

  Muhammad emerged in a polytheistic Arabian society steeped in intertribal warfare, lacking any indigenous tradition of scripture, philosophy, or systematic theology, yet the Qur’an he recited over twenty-three years introduced profound concepts like tawhid, eschatological accountability, and social justice that unified fractious tribes and sparked an intellectual renaissance. Within a single generation, this illiterate orphan from Quraysh transformed the Arabian Peninsula from a backwater of warring nomads into the nucleus of a civilization that rivaled the Byzantine and Sassanid empires, as evidenced by the rapid conquests and administrative reforms post-632 CE. Western academics such as Montgomery Watt affirm that Muhammad's leadership fused spiritual authority with practical governance in a manner unprecedented in Arabia, reshaping not only morals but also poetry, law, and economics.[^8] The Qur’an itself attests to his illiteracy, stating:

  > You (O' Messenger) did not recite before it any scripture, nor did you inscribe one
  > with your right hand.
  > (Qur’an 29:48)

  Common alternative explanations for Muhammad's role falter under historical, psychological, and textual scrutiny, each undermined by primary sources and modern scholarship. The theory of deliberate imposture collapses because Muhammad derived no worldly benefit from his claims, actively rejecting Quraysh bribes of kingship, wealth, and marriage alliances if he ceased preaching. Instead, he endured thirteen years of escalating Meccan persecution: verbal abuse, economic boycott, physical assaults, and the three-year starvation ordeal of the Banu Hashim clan (616-619 CE), which killed his wife Khadijah and uncle Abu Talib, forcing the Hijrah to Medina in 622 CE amid assassination plots.[^9]

  Theories of the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ's delusion or insanity fail against the Qur’an’s remarkable internal coherence, Muhammad's astute leadership, and his personal stability. Revealed over twenty-three years, the text maintains doctrinal unity across disparate contexts without contradiction, a feat psychologists like W. Montgomery Watt deem improbable for delusional disorders. His conduct in key events reflects strategic awareness rather than impaired perception. At Badr (624 CE), he successfully confronted a larger Meccan force through careful planning and tactical positioning. Later, the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah (628 CE) shows deliberate diplomacy, as he accepted short-term concessions to secure long-term stability and political advantage. These actions are consistent with rational decision-making and long-term planning, not hallucination or disordered thinking.[^10]

  Claims that the Qur’an was borrowed from Judaism, Christianity, or Arabian folklore become difficult to sustain when the historical context is examined carefully. Muhammad was known to be illiterate and had no access to centers of theological learning, as Mecca was not a hub for sustained interaction with rabbis, monks, or scriptural scholars. More importantly, the Qur’an does not merely repeat earlier religious material but frequently challenges it. It explicitly rejects central Christian doctrines such as the Trinity and the incarnation of God, critiques what it describes as alterations in earlier scriptures, and presents its own theological framework with a distinct emphasis on divine oneness and accountability.[^11] 

  Ultimately, the historical evidences points toward a simpler and more coherent explanation, that he was truthful in his claim. Prior to prophethood, Muhammad ﷺ was widely known for honesty and reliability, earning the title al-Amīn. He conveyed a message that was preserved orally and in writing, marked by a distinctive and inimitable literary character, and accompanied by publicly observable signs, all while emerging from a social and economic context that offered no clear pathway to personal gain or authority. 

  # Conclusion
  In summary, the case for Islam as the true religion does not rest on emotional appeal or inherited belief, but on a cumulative rational assessment. The existence of a necessary and independent Creator offers the most coherent explanation for why anything exists at all. The oneness of this Creator follows logically from the nature of necessary existence, while the limits of human reason point to the need for revealed guidance. The Qur'an presents itself as that revelation and withstands scrutiny through its preservation, distinctive literary character, internal coherence, and measured predictive claims. The life of Muhammad ﷺ further supports this conclusion, as neither deception nor delusion plausibly accounts for the message he delivered or the enduring impact it produced. Taken together, these considerations form a unified and consistent worldview in which Islam emerges not as a cultural tradition or subjective preference, but as an objective truth.
